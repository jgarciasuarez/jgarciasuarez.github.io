## About me

I am a postdoctoral scholar in the department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering (MCE) of Caltech, working under joint supervision of Prof. Chiara Daraio and Prof. Domniki Asimaki. 

I received a PhD in Aeronautics at the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT) with a minor in Applied and Computational Mathematics, as well as a Master’s in Space Engineering from the same institution. I received my “Ingeniero Industrial” diploma from the University of Seville (Spain) in 2013.

My PhD work, supervised by Prof. Domniki Asimaki (MCE) and closely followed also by Prof. Michael Ortiz (GALCIT), focused mostly on exploring applications of the path-independent integrals of Continuum Mechanics (as the renowned J-integral of Fracture Mechanics) in the field of Soil-Structure Interaction. Additionally, I also worked in the area of 1D Site Response Analysis, where I collaborated with Prof. Elnaz E. Seylabi (now at University of Nevada at Reno, UNR).

Currently, I am studying the feasibility of seismic meta-materials in realistic scenarios by bringing up the actual nuances of earthquake engineering (heterogeneous medium, non-linear soil response, transient loading) to the picture. My general interests lie at the intersection of Geomechanics, Theoretical Solid Mechanics and Applied Mathematics.

## Projects

- **Application of Path-Independent Integrals to Soil-Structure Interaction (Jun. 2016 – Dec. 2019)**    

My PhD work focused on studying the potential of the path-independent integrals of Continuum Mechanics, customary tools mostly used in the context of Fracture Mechanics, to provide a new approach to problems in Soil-Structure Interaction. I was chiefly interested in the problem of assessment of seismic increment of pressures on rigid walls: the exact solution of the classic problem considered by Veletsos and Younan as well as its first comprehensive simplified model were provided.

- **One-dimensional Site Response Analysis (Oct. 2018 – Present)**   

This ongoing collaboration with Prof. Seylabi (UNR) represents a research effort to gain understanding on the mechanics of ground deformation during earthquake events, and how to define equivalent homogeneous properties and simple results that could be incorporated to seismic codes. Currently we are considering the linear, small-strain regime, but our goal is to obtain results relevant to intense shaking that can trigger non-linear soil response.

- **Realistic Seismic Metamaterials (Jan. 2020 – Present)**   

I intend tackling the problem of design of seismic metamaterials, which has already received wide attention in recent years, accounting for characteristic features of large-amplitude transient soil response that had been left unaccounted for until now. These traits include the transient character of seismic loading, the heterogeneity intrinsic to the upper layers of the Earth crust and the non-linear behavior of soils when subjected to intense loads.  
This project will also include the development of new features for Asimaki’s in-house, open FEM code, Seismo Virtual Lab (SVL).
