## About me

I am a postdoctoral scholar in the department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering of Caltech (Prof. Domniki Asimaki's group). 

I received a PhD in Aeronautics at the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT) with a minor in Applied and Computational Mathematics, as well as a Master’s in Space Engineering from the same institution. I received my “Ingeniero Industrial” diploma from the University of Seville (Spain) in 2013.

My PhD work, supervised by Prof. Domniki Asimaki (MCE) and closely followed also by Prof. Michael Ortiz (GALCIT), focused mostly on exploring applications of the path-independent integrals of Continuum Mechanics (as the renowned J-integral of Fracture Mechanics) in the field of Soil-Structure Interaction. Additionally, I also worked in the area of 1D Site Response Analysis, where I collaborated with Prof. Elnaz E. Seylabi (now at University of Nevada at Reno, UNR).

Currently, I am studying the feasibility of seismic meta-materials in realistic scenarios by bringing up the actual nuances of earthquake engineering (heterogeneous medium, non-linear soil response, transient loading) to the picture. My general interests lie at the intersection of Geomechanics, Theoretical Solid Mechanics and Applied Mathematics.


## A partial list of research topics I’m interested in:

- **Numerical simulation of tribological surfaces**

Utilizing numerical simulations to capture the micro and nano phenomena that control the creation of wear debris and the emergence of friciton during sliding of contacting surfaces. 

- **Geophysics problems involving discrete particles: fault gouge**

There are a number of open problems in geophysics that would benefit enormously from a numerical framework able of capturing interaction between continuum and discrete media. In particular, one of such problems is the mechanics of fault gouge: the ability to simulate faithfully its evolution can bring about deep insights on earthquake sources. 

- **Wave propagation in layered media**

Being able to comprehend how the mechanical properties of the layering of a certain system affects the propagation of linear elastic waves in it can have a large impact in a number of (apparently) very different fields: for instance, it can help design dispersion relation in laminates, or it can allow assessing the influence of certain soil strata in seismic ground amplification. The knowledge of the exact form of the entries of the global transfer matrix (see publication titled "Trace spectrum of 1D Transfer Matrices for wave propagation in layered media") could resolve open questions in these fields.

- **Seismic Response of Rock Pinnacles**

Understanding the mechanics of seismic response of rock towers (a certain kind of fragile geological feature) using FEM simulations along with structural engineering models, to later update Seismic Hazard estimations. 

- **One-dimensional Site Response Analysis**   

Assessing ground deformation during earthquake events under idealized conditions, and how to define equivalent homogeneous properties and simple results that could be incorporated to seismic codes.

- **Application of Path-Independent Integrals to Soil-Structure Interaction**    

My PhD work focused on studying the potential of the path-independent integrals of Continuum Mechanics to provide a new approach to problems in Soil-Structure Interaction. I was chiefly interested in the problem of assessment of seismic increment of pressures on retaining walls.

- **Realistic Seismic Metamaterials**

How to engineer the soil around a structure in order to protect it from seismic waves (both sufarce and bulk waves).
