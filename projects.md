# Projects

I am currently PI in a project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF), titled "Data-Driven Computational Friction" (DDCF). 

This project aims to revolutionize how we account for frictional phenomena in simulations where friction is just one, yet a decisive, factor to consider (e.g., residual bering capacity of concrete due to aggregate interlocking, geophysical faulting). Differnet data-driven approaches are being explored.
