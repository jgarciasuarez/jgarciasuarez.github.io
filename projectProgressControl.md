# Project Progress Control

This document is the source of truth for the development of Joaquin Garcia-Suarez's academic portfolio website.
It records the verified state of the application, the prioritized backlog, validation results, and every material
change made during development.

## Documentation Protocol

1. Update this file whenever code, content, dependencies, assets, configuration, or deployment state changes.
2. Add every newly discovered task to the prioritized backlog before or while implementing it.
3. Mark a task complete only after the relevant validation has passed.
4. Record the validation command and result in the change log.
5. Use the files in `context-in-text/` as the content source of truth:
   - `CV_May_2026-1.md` for biographical facts, dates, metrics, publications, teaching, and mentoring.
   - `research_statement_4_Carlson.md` for the research narrative.
   - `teaching_statement_4_Carlson.md` for the teaching narrative.
   - `goal.md` for product and design requirements.

Task states:

- `[ ]` Pending
- `[~]` In progress
- `[x]` Completed and verified
- `[!]` Blocked or awaiting user-provided information

## Current Verified State

- **Branch:** `agentic_web_design`
- **Remote tracking:** `agentic_web_design` is synchronized with `jgarciasuarez/web`, the production deployment
  repository `jgarciasuarez/jgarciasuarez.github.io`, and the staging repository
  `CarlosCHD24/CarlosCHD24.github.io`
- **Framework:** Next.js 16.2.12, React 19, TypeScript, App Router, CSS Modules
- **Implemented routes:** `/`, `/research`, `/teaching`, `/ddcf`
- **Production build:** passing
- **Static export:** 78 files / 7.41 MiB, below the automated 12 MiB budget
- **TypeScript:** passing through `next build`
- **Local route check:** all four routes respond successfully; `/ddcf` returns HTTP 200 after the current implementation
- **Lint:** passing
- **Automated tests:** 4 component tests and 29 Playwright route, responsive, navigation, dialog-interaction, and
  accessibility tests
  passing
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions runs lint, component tests, staging and production SEO builds, structured-data/export
  validation, the reviewed dependency-security baseline, and Playwright before packaging Pages. A weekly
  maintenance workflow repeats the production SEO validation, checks external links, and compares the open
  Dependabot alert count with the reviewed baseline
- **Staging:** `https://carloschd24.github.io` is published from GitHub Actions with staging canonicals and
  search-engine indexing disabled
- **DDCF status:** interactive React Flow hub implemented, production-built, and locally reachable
- **Content coverage audit:** completed; prioritized editorial gaps are documented in
  `context-in-text/content_gap_audit_2026-07-30.md`

- [x] Add CI that runs lint, tests, and production build.

### P2 — Social Metadata, SEO, and Automatic Maintenance

- [x] Visually review the 1536 × 1024 Open Graph card for legibility, content accuracy, and consistency with the
  DDCF visual language.
- [x] Emit complete route-specific Open Graph and X card metadata, including the social image and alternative text,
  on all four primary routes.
- [x] Validate the Person and WebSite JSON-LD graph, including identity, EPFL affiliation, email, canonical URL, and
  verified profile links.
- [x] Enforce `noindex, nofollow` on the Carlos staging build and independently validate `index, follow` for the
  Joaquin production build.
- [x] Add weekly Dependabot version updates for npm and GitHub Actions on `agentic_web_design`.
- [x] Add a weekly production-mode SEO, structured-data, and external-link maintenance workflow.
- [x] Record and automatically compare the reviewed runtime security baseline: three high alerts and one medium
  alert affecting the transitive `postcss` and `sharp` versions pinned by Next.js 16.2.12.
- [!] Activate the same scheduled maintenance and Dependabot configuration in the Joaquin repositories after the
  owner makes `agentic_web_design` the production/default branch. GitHub reads scheduled workflows and
  `.github/dependabot.yml` from the repository default branch.

### P2 — Documentation, Dependencies, and Assets

- [x] Reconcile stale route checklists in `frontend/src/app/agent_instructions.md`.
- [x] Remove references to missing `summaryContext.md` and `ModernWebPage.md`.
- [x] Replace the generic Next.js README with project-specific setup and architecture documentation.
- [x] Review unused MDX, Lucide, React Flow, and Framer Motion dependencies after DDCF implementation. Removed the
  four unused MDX packages; retained Lucide, React Flow, and Framer Motion because they are actively imported.
- [!] Resolve the three high-severity runtime advisories affecting transitive `postcss` and `sharp` versions. A
  fourth medium-severity `postcss` advisory is also tracked. Next.js 16.2.12 remains the reviewed framework version
  and pins the affected dependencies; the deployed site is static and does not execute these packages at request
  time, so retain the supported dependency graph and re-evaluate on the next compatible Next.js release. The local
  lockfile baseline and GitHub Dependabot alert count now fail CI if this reviewed state changes.
- [x] Review unused images and remove or integrate them.
- [x] Optimize large raster assets and verify production delivery sizes.
- [x] Serve WebP variants of the four heaviest referenced scientific figures, reducing their combined transfer
  size from 4,362,574 bytes to 772,102 bytes (82.3%) while preserving the corrected PNG sources.
- [x] Add a responsive `sizes` value to the filled `model_hw.png` image.
- [x] Eager-load the above-the-fold `contact_across_scales.png` LCP image and provide responsive sizes.
- [x] Remove unused starter SVGs and unused `src/app/page.module.css`.
- [!] Restore a direct `soft-contact` software link only if a public repository URL is confirmed. The documented
  GitHub URL currently returns 404 and was removed from the public interface.

### P2 — Deployment Readiness

- [x] Select GitHub Pages as the low-cost hosting target, with GitHub Actions as the only deployment controller.
- [x] Make font delivery deterministic by self-hosting the official Inter variable font and its license.
- [x] Configure Next.js to generate a trailing-slash static export in `frontend/out`.
- [x] Add and remotely validate the GitHub Pages deployment workflow through artifact packaging.
- [x] Mirror `agentic_web_design` into `jgarciasuarez/jgarciasuarez.github.io` without modifying its legacy
  `master` branch.
- [x] Preserve the complete legacy website in the dedicated `legacy-site-2026` branch, pointing to the unchanged
  `master` commit `dbd06a54b795483e020702ef2b2f18e53fd4626e`.
- [x] Preserve the existing Carlos Pages template in `legacy-site-before-agentic-2026`, pointing to the unchanged
  `main` commit `d370ae9ff9ae220f63ffdfe09c09c84e1bcea7c9` before preparing the staging site.
- [x] Make the Pages workflow portable across the Carlos staging and Joaquin production repositories using
  repository-controlled site origin, indexing, and deployment gates.
- [x] Validate both a noindex staging export and an indexable production export before configuring Carlos Pages.
- [x] Mirror `agentic_web_design` into `CarlosCHD24/CarlosCHD24.github.io`, configure the staging repository
  variables, and make the branch the repository default.
- [x] Switch Carlos Pages from the legacy `main` source to GitHub Actions and publish the validated noindex staging
  site at `https://carloschd24.github.io`.
- [!] Switch the existing GitHub Pages publishing source from legacy `master` to GitHub Actions. The available
  Git credential can push code but does not have the administrative Pages permission required for this setting.
- [x] Gate Pages deployment behind the repository variable `PAGES_DEPLOY_ENABLED`; pushes still validate and
  package the site, while neither staging nor production can deploy until its owner explicitly enables the gate.
- [x] Configure the production origin and automated pre-deployment export checks.
- [~] Perform a final content, browser, performance, and link audit. Local routes, responsive layouts,
  accessibility, internal references, external URLs, 404 behavior, static caching, and artifact size are verified;
  repeat the production-only checks after Pages is enabled.
- [!] Publish the validated project through GitHub Pages; awaiting repository-administrator access to change the
  publishing source from legacy `master` to GitHub Actions.

## Completed Work

### Foundation and Architecture

- [x] Initialized Next.js with App Router, TypeScript, ESLint, and CSS Modules.
- [x] Created reusable Navigation, Hero, Stats, Research Preview, Education Timeline, and Footer components.
- [x] Defined a shared dark design system in `frontend/src/app/globals.css`.
- [x] Added and processed source PDFs, extracted figures, and web-ready images.

- [x] Home/Bio visual foundation.
- [x] Research page with three research themes and selected publications.
- [x] Teaching page with philosophy, methods, experience, proposed courses, and mentoring summary.
- [x] DDCF route scaffold.

### Verified on 2026-07-30

- [x] Production build completed successfully with Next.js 16.2.12.
- [x] TypeScript validation completed successfully during the production build.
- [x] `/`, `/research`, `/teaching`, and `/ddcf` rendered without browser console errors.
- [x] Git branch confirmed clean and synchronized before the current work.

## Change Log

### 2026-07-31 — DDCF Full-Image Viewer Completed

- Audited the five DDCF dialog images and confirmed that the shared `object-fit: cover` treatment hid substantial
  scientific content, particularly in the panoramic friction, neural-operator, and GPU figures.
- Preserved the cropped image treatment as the visual dialog cover while converting the complete media surface
  into a labelled image-viewer control with a visible enlargement affordance.
- Added a full-viewport mode inside the existing accessible dialog rather than nesting a second modal.
- Rendered expanded images with `object-fit: contain`, their original aspect ratio, a dark neutral stage, and the
  existing descriptive alternative text as a visible caption.
- Added hierarchical dismissal and focus management:
  - The first Escape or backdrop action returns from the full image to project details.
  - A subsequent Escape closes the project details.
  - Closing the image restores focus to its originating media control.
  - Opening the image places focus on its dedicated close control.
- Added responsive sizing with `vh` and `dvh` fallbacks so the viewer remains fully inside desktop and mobile
  viewports.
- Added Playwright coverage for all five images, natural image loading, `contain` rendering, viewport containment,
  focus restoration, Escape behavior, mobile dimensions, and WCAG A/AA checks with the viewer open.
- Validation:
  - ESLint: passed with zero errors and zero warnings.
  - Component tests: 2 files / 4 tests passed.
  - Staging production build and TypeScript: passed.
  - Static export validation: passed for 78 files / 7.39 MiB with staging canonical and noindex policy.
  - Playwright: 29 of 29 tests passed.
  - Browser audit at 1280 × 720: the viewer remained within the viewport, focused its close control, and rendered
    the 3,368 × 2,382 DDCF collage with `object-fit: contain`.
  - GitHub Actions run `30626609021`: quality, Pages packaging, and Pages deployment passed for commit
    `b9881fcbe98e2033b72a52df363062a3812794b0`.
  - Published staging audit at 1280 × 720: the full-image viewer stayed within 32 px viewport margins, rendered the
    complete collage with `object-fit: contain`, and returned focus to the labelled image trigger when closed.

### 2026-07-31 — DDCF Dialog Overflow Regression Fixed

- Reproduced the reported failure on the published staging site at 1280 × 720.
- Measured a 656 px-high dialog whose content column retained a 1,333 px intrinsic height. The grid item could not
  shrink, while the parent dialog clipped the excess with `overflow: hidden`, leaving no usable scroll surface.
- Constrained the dialog's grid row and allowed its media and content children to shrink inside the available
  dynamic viewport height.
- Made the content column the explicit scroll surface with contained overscroll and stable scrollbar space.
- Added a named, keyboard-focusable content region and a visible focus treatment so keyboard users can scroll the
  complete description.
- Preserved the existing full-dialog mobile scroll pattern below 850 px.
- Added Playwright regression coverage that opens all five DDCF dialogs at 1280 × 720 and verifies:
  - The content column remains inside the visible dialog.
  - Keyboard and pointer-wheel scrolling reach the end of overflowing content.
  - Escape closes each dialog and restores focus to its originating node.
  - The complete central-project content and final resource remain reachable at 390 × 844.
- Validation:
  - ESLint: passed with zero errors and zero warnings.
  - Component tests: 2 files / 4 tests passed.
  - Staging production build and TypeScript: passed.
  - Static export validation: passed for 78 files / 7.39 MiB with staging canonical and noindex policy.
  - Playwright: 27 of 27 tests passed.
  - GitHub Actions run `30625455264`: quality, Pages packaging, and Pages deployment passed for commit
    `22b172c7d6d09f105f6d3e663dffa341f4214959`.
  - Published staging audit at 1280 × 720: the 654 px content viewport remains inside the 656 px dialog, exposes
    its complete 1,333 px scrollable content, and no longer gets clipped by the parent grid.

### 2026-07-31 — Carlos GitHub Pages Staging Published

- Changed `CarlosCHD24/CarlosCHD24.github.io` from legacy branch publishing to GitHub Actions.
- Enabled `PAGES_DEPLOY_ENABLED` only after Pages reported `build_type: workflow`; retained
  `SITE_URL=https://carloschd24.github.io` and `SITE_INDEXING=false`.
- Manually dispatched workflow run `30624151922`. Quality, Pages packaging, and deployment all completed
  successfully, publishing commit `95e8c446469520d9710cdb80bcf0adeb3a2d713d`.
- Verified the live staging site:
  - `/`, `/research/`, `/teaching/`, and `/ddcf/` return HTTP 200 with the expected headings and one semantic main
    landmark.
  - Canonical and Open Graph origins use `https://carloschd24.github.io`.
  - Every primary route emits `noindex, nofollow`; `robots.txt` disallows all crawling and does not advertise a
    sitemap.
  - The CV, sitemap, and robots resources return their correct content types; a missing route returns HTTP 404.
  - Browser inspection found no console errors, warnings, or horizontal overflow.
- Deleted the obsolete remote `main` branch after successful publication. Its original commit
  `d370ae9ff9ae220f63ffdfe09c09c84e1bcea7c9` remains recoverable from
  `legacy-site-before-agentic-2026`.
- Confirmed `agentic_web_design` remains the default branch and Pages remains healthy in workflow mode after the
  old branch was removed.

### 2026-07-31 — Carlos Staging Repository Prepared

- Added `CarlosCHD24/CarlosCHD24.github.io` as the `staging` Git remote and synchronized
  `agentic_web_design` at commit `6e4d4b3e72217e4963cb892e5a3f2cbe56f6e7c0`.
- Configured the staging repository variables as:
  - `SITE_URL=https://carloschd24.github.io`.
  - `SITE_INDEXING=false`.
  - `PAGES_DEPLOY_ENABLED=false`.
- GitHub Actions run `30623706409` passed the complete quality suite and Pages artifact packaging in the Carlos
  repository; `deploy-pages` was skipped by the disabled gate.
- Changed the Carlos repository default branch from `main` to `agentic_web_design` only after the remote preflight
  passed.
- Verified that Pages remains in legacy mode and still publishes the unchanged `main` commit
  `d370ae9ff9ae220f63ffdfe09c09c84e1bcea7c9`. The same commit remains recoverable from
  `legacy-site-before-agentic-2026`.
- The next step remains explicit: switch Carlos Pages to GitHub Actions and then enable the deployment gate. No
  published website changed during this preparation step.

### 2026-07-31 — Portable Staging Configuration and Local Validation Completed

- Preserved the existing `CarlosCHD24/CarlosCHD24.github.io` template in
  `legacy-site-before-agentic-2026`. The backup and `main` both point to the verified source commit
  `d370ae9ff9ae220f63ffdfe09c09c84e1bcea7c9`.
- Added environment-controlled search indexing. Staging exports emit `noindex, nofollow` metadata and a blocking
  `robots.txt`; production exports opt into indexing and advertise the generated sitemap.
- Made the static export validator derive its expected canonical URLs and crawler behavior from the same build
  environment as Next.js.
- Generalized the Pages workflow for the Carlos staging and Joaquin production repositories using `SITE_URL`,
  `SITE_INDEXING`, and the fail-closed `PAGES_DEPLOY_ENABLED` repository gate.
- Updated the official checkout, Node setup, artifact, and Pages actions to their current Node 24-compatible major
  versions after the first remote preflight exposed GitHub's Node 20 deprecation warning.
- Kept `jgarciasuarez/web` outside the deployment allowlist and left both live Pages configurations unchanged.
- Validation completed:
  - Workflow YAML and whitespace validation passed.
  - ESLint passed.
  - Vitest passed: 2 files, 4 tests.
  - The Carlos staging build passed TypeScript and static generation; its 78-file, 7.39 MiB export validated with
    `https://carloschd24.github.io` canonicals and noindex behavior.
  - Playwright passed all 25 route, responsive, navigation, and accessibility checks against the staging export.
  - The Joaquin production build passed TypeScript and static generation; its 78-file, 7.39 MiB export validated
    with `https://jgarciasuarez.github.io` canonicals and indexable crawler behavior.
  - Final Node 24-compatible remote preflight passed on `jgarciasuarez/web` in run `30623325476`.
  - Final Pages packaging passed on `jgarciasuarez/jgarciasuarez.github.io` in run `30623326957`; `deploy-pages`
    was skipped by the disabled repository gate, and the legacy live site remained untouched.

### 2026-07-30 — Legacy Website Branch Preserved

- Created `legacy-site-2026` in `jgarciasuarez/jgarciasuarez.github.io` as an exact branch copy of the existing
  `master` commit `dbd06a54b795483e020702ef2b2f18e53fd4626e`.
- Kept `master` unchanged and left it as the active GitHub Pages source, so the currently published website was
  not replaced or interrupted.

### 2026-07-30 — Documentation, Dependency, Asset, and Pre-Deployment Cleanup Completed

- Replaced the generic Next.js README with project-specific installation, architecture, content-source,
  static-export, testing, environment, and GitHub delivery documentation.
- Reconciled the frontend and App Router agent instructions with all four completed routes, the real
  `context-in-text/` source hierarchy, current validation requirements, and the Pages permission gate.
- Removed the unused `@mdx-js/loader`, `@mdx-js/react`, `@next/mdx`, and `@types/mdx` packages and refreshed the
  npm lockfile. Confirmed Lucide, React Flow, and Framer Motion remain active application dependencies.
- Re-ran `npm audit --omit=dev` against the official registry:
  - Three high-severity findings remain through Next.js 16.2.12's pinned PostCSS and Sharp dependencies.
  - Next.js 16.2.12 is still the latest stable release.
  - npm proposes an invalid breaking downgrade to Next.js 9.3.3, so no forced fix or unsupported transitive
    override was applied.
  - The exported GitHub Pages site has no request-time Node.js runtime and processes no untrusted build inputs,
    limiting the findings to the trusted build environment until an official compatible update is available.
- Removed exact public duplicates of figures already preserved in `context/figures/extracted/`, moved the two
  corrected PNG source files into `context/figures/web-corrected/`, and removed the duplicated `public/og.png`,
  starter SVGs, and unused root CSS Module.
- Reduced visitor-facing `public/` content from 13,267,436 bytes to 1,594,911 bytes (88.0%) and the generated
  static export from 19,422,898 bytes to 7,750,373 bytes (60.1%).
- Replaced the incompatible `next start` command with a dependency-free static export server supporting route
  indexes, 404 responses, MIME types, HEAD requests, and immutable caching for hashed Next assets.
- Added an export validator that checks:
  - Required routes, metadata resources, CV, WebP figures, and bundled Inter font.
  - Correct canonical URLs, sitemap, robots, and every local `href`/`src`.
  - Absence of retired assets and external Google Fonts.
  - Absence of symlinks and compliance with a 12 MiB Pages artifact budget.
- Updated Playwright to test the production-like static export instead of the development server. This avoids a
  reproduced Next.js 16.2.12 Turbopack panic under concurrent cold `/ddcf` requests and makes the browser suite
  exercise the same artifact that GitHub Pages will receive.
- Audited 29 external URLs. The only genuine 404 was the documented `soft-contact` repository, which is no longer
  public; its card was removed while retaining the verified GitHub profile and DDCF dataset links. DOI publisher
  403 responses and EPFL rate-limit 429 responses were retained because their canonical targets remain valid.
- Updated GitHub Actions so both the quality and Pages packaging paths validate the static export, and browser
  tests run only after the production artifact is built.
- Paused the blocked final Pages job behind manual GitHub workflow dispatch. Regular pushes continue to run the
  complete quality and artifact build without producing an expected deployment failure; once an administrator
  enables GitHub Actions as the Pages source, one manual run completes publication.
- Final validation:
  - Clean `npm ci` installation passed from the updated lockfile.
  - ESLint passed.
  - Vitest passed: 2 files, 4 tests.
  - Next.js 16.2.12 production build and TypeScript validation passed; all routes are static.
  - Export validation passed: 78 files, 7.39 MiB.
  - Static server smoke tests returned 200 for all routes and generated resources, 404 for a missing route, and
    immutable caching for hashed assets.
  - Playwright passed: 25 route, responsive, navigation, and accessibility tests.
  - GitHub Actions workflow YAML parsed successfully.
  - Remote workflow run `30567940320` passed both `quality` and `build-pages`; `deploy-pages` was skipped as
    intended while the administrative Pages setting remains paused.

### 2026-07-30 — GitHub Pages Automation Steps 3–4 Prepared

- Extended the existing quality workflow with a gated static-site packaging and GitHub Pages deployment stage.
- Kept publication conditional on the repository being `jgarciasuarez/jgarciasuarez.github.io`, preventing the
  source repository `jgarciasuarez/web` from accidentally publishing at the incompatible `/web` base path.
- Preserved the existing personal-site `master` branch as the rollback source; the new application will be
  introduced on `agentic_web_design`.
- Added manual workflow dispatch support for controlled deployment and recovery.
- Mirrored `agentic_web_design` to both `jgarciasuarez/web` and
  `jgarciasuarez/jgarciasuarez.github.io`; the existing personal-site `master` branch remains unchanged at
  `dbd06a54b795483e020702ef2b2f18e53fd4626e`.
- Remote workflow run `30565700639` completed the full quality job and the Pages artifact build successfully.
- The final `deploy-pages` job was correctly reached but GitHub rejected it with: “Invalid deployment branch and
  no branch protection rules set in the environment. Deployments are only allowed from master.”
- Confirmed through the Pages API that the live site remains healthy and configured with `build_type: legacy`,
  source `master` at `/`.
- Attempting to switch `build_type` to `workflow` returned HTTP 404 because the available collaborator credential
  lacks administrative Pages access. No force push or change to the live legacy site was made.
- Remaining administrative action: an owner must select **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source:
  GitHub Actions**. Re-running the existing workflow will then complete the publication without a local machine.

### 2026-07-30 — GitHub Pages Preparation Steps 1–2 Completed

- Configured Next.js with `output: "export"`, trailing-slash routes, and unoptimized static image delivery so
  `npm run build` now produces a GitHub Pages-compatible site in `frontend/out`.
- Declared the generated `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` routes as static, as required by Next.js 16 for static
  export mode.
- Removed the production-build dependency on Google Fonts by adding the official Inter 4.66 variable WOFF2 file,
  retaining its SIL Open Font License, and loading it through `next/font/local`.
- Added visually verified WebP variants for the four largest referenced scientific figures and updated Home,
  Research, and DDCF to serve them. Their combined browser payload fell from 4,362,574 bytes to 772,102 bytes,
  an 82.3% reduction; corrected PNG sources remain available for future asset curation.
- Validation completed:
  - ESLint passed.
  - Vitest passed: 2 files, 4 tests.
  - Playwright passed: 25 route, responsive, and accessibility tests.
  - Next.js 16.2.12 generated all application routes, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and the Open Graph image as
    static content without fetching Google Fonts.
  - A standalone static HTTP server returned HTTP 200 for `/`, `/research/`, `/teaching/`, `/ddcf/`,
    `/robots.txt`, and `/sitemap.xml`; the exported HTML referenced the bundled Inter font and WebP figures.
- GitHub repository migration, Pages configuration, and the deployment workflow remain deliberately pending for
  the next steps.

### 2026-07-30 — P2 Automated Quality Gate Completed

- Added Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright, and axe-core as development dependencies while preserving the
  npm lockfile.
- Added four component tests covering:
  - Verified publication and grant metrics.
  - Verified software, dataset, and recognition links.
  - Active-route semantics in the primary navigation.
  - Mobile-menu open, Escape dismissal, and focus restoration.
- Added 25 Chromium E2E tests covering:
  - HTTP rendering and primary content for `/`, `/research`, `/teaching`, and `/ddcf`.
  - Horizontal-overflow protection for all four routes at 390, 768, 1280, and 1536 px widths.
  - Visibility of all primary navigation routes in the mobile menu.
  - Automated WCAG 2 A/AA and WCAG 2.1 A/AA scans on all four routes.
- The first accessibility run exposed insufficient contrast in muted copy and the secondary violet. Raised the
  shared muted color, introduced an accessible violet, corrected remaining local muted colors, and increased the
  visibility of Research theme numbers. The complete accessibility suite then passed with zero automatically
  detectable violations.
- Added eager loading to the first Research theme image after the browser suite identified it as an LCP candidate.
- Added `.github/workflows/quality.yml` to run dependency installation, Chromium setup, lint, component tests,
  route/responsive/accessibility tests, and the production build on pull requests and pushes to
  `agentic_web_design`. Failed runs retain the Playwright report for seven days.
- Added local scripts for component watch mode, E2E execution/reporting, the complete test suite, and the CI quality
  gate.
- Final validation:
  - ESLint passed.
  - Vitest passed: 2 files, 4 tests.
  - Playwright passed: 25 tests.
  - Next.js 16.2.12 production build and TypeScript validation passed; all four primary routes were generated.
  - GitHub Actions workflow YAML parsed successfully.
- `npm audit --omit=dev` reported three high-severity production advisories through the current Next.js transitive
  `postcss` and `sharp` versions. The proposed forced fix is a breaking downgrade to Next.js 9 and was deliberately
  not applied; a compatible framework/dependency update is now tracked separately.
- Deployment and the separate P2 documentation/dependency cleanup remain outside this testing iteration.

### 2026-07-30 — Pre-P2 Content Enrichment Completed

- Completed content-audit points 1–5; automated testing and CI remain explicitly reserved for the next iteration.
- Corrected the visible `JMPS (2022)` reference to `JMPS (2023)` and both visible `JFM (2025)` references to
  `JFM (2024)` in new, non-destructive image variants:
  - `frontend/public/images/contact_across_scales_corrected.png`
  - `frontend/public/images/DDCF_collage_corrected.png`
- Updated all visible Research, Home, and DDCF references to use the corrected figures while preserving the
  original assets.
- Added the 2026 Tribology Letters article “A matter of shape”, relabeled the curated records as selected
  publications, and added direct routes to the complete ORCID and CV records.
- Added a compact Home evidence block covering continuum mechanics, applied mathematics, numerical methods,
  Python, C++, Wolfram Mathematica, high-performance/GPU workflows, the verified `soft-contact` repository, and
  the DDCF Zenodo dataset.
- Added two anonymized student testimonials and explicitly identified the two supervised projects that developed
  into peer-reviewed publications.
- Added a concise “Current direction” roadmap to each research pillar and a separate seismic/geotechnical
  foundation block without introducing a fourth research pillar.
- Added selective recognition, invited-talk, and scientific-programme leadership evidence, followed by a
  collaboration and invited-seminar CTA.
- Added the two explicit `goal.md` gaps: X is now present in the Bio professional links, and the official SNSF mark
  is visible inside the central interactive DDCF node.
- Clarified the Home publication metric as “24 peer-reviewed articles”.
- Validation completed:
  - ESLint passed with no warnings or errors.
  - Next.js 16.2.12 production build and TypeScript validation passed.
  - `/`, `/research`, `/teaching`, and `/ddcf` were generated successfully as static routes.
  - The local development server remains active at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

### 2026-07-30 — Cross-Project Content Coverage Audit

- Compared the May 2026 CV, research statement, teaching statement, project goal, DDCF specification, supervised
  project records, figure notes, and supporting bibliography with all content implemented on `/`, `/research`,
  `/teaching`, and `/ddcf`.
- Created `context-in-text/content_gap_audit_2026-07-30.md` with a coverage matrix and prioritized recommendations.
- Confirmed strong coverage of the core identity, three research pillars, teaching narrative, and DDCF programme.
- Identified the highest-value missing signals:
  - Latest 2026 research output and a route to the complete publication record.
  - Technical capabilities and verified research software.
  - Teaching testimonials and publication-linked mentoring outcomes.
  - The forward research programme and the seismic/geotechnical foundation.
  - Selective recognition, invited talks, and leadership.
- Identified an explicit `goal.md` gap: the SNSF logo is on the DDCF page but not inside the central interactive node.
- Identified an explicit Bio gap: X is available in the Footer but not in the Bio links requested by `goal.md`.
- Identified stale publication years embedded in three visible images and added their correction ahead of new
  content work.
- Kept low-value or time-sensitive CV material out of the recommended public surface, including the full student
  roster, full service lists, society memberships, peer-review lists, and the unresolved submitted HyperMech
  proposal.
- No public website copy or layout was changed during this audit.

### 2026-07-30 — CV Download Button Visual Adjustment Completed

- Reduced the prominence of the Bio CV download button.

### 2026-07-30 — Accessibility and SEO P1 Completed

- Added route-specific canonical URLs and Open Graph URLs for `/`, `/research`, `/teaching`, and `/ddcf`.
- Set `metadataBase` to the verified academic website by default and added `frontend/.env.example` so a final
  production origin can be supplied through `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.
- Added:
  - A generated `robots.txt` allowing public crawling.
  - A generated `sitemap.xml` covering all four primary routes.
  - JSON-LD structured data describing the portfolio website and Joaquin Garcia-Suarez as a person.
- Marked the home particle canvas, badge marker, and glow as decorative for assistive technologies.
- Stopped particle movement when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active while retaining a static visual.
- Validation:
  - ESLint: passed with zero errors and zero warnings.
  - Next.js production build and TypeScript: passed.
  - Static generation: passed for ten outputs, including `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml`.
  - Generated HTML contains the expected absolute canonical and Open Graph URL on all four primary routes.
  - Generated `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` contain the configured canonical origin and all primary routes.
  - Local server: restarted successfully; `/` returns HTTP 200 and both crawler resources are reachable.

### 2026-07-30 — DDCF Content Dependency Resolution

- Reviewed the local goal, DDCF collage, research statement, and May 2026 CV.
- Reviewed the official SNSF Data Portal record for grant 216341.
- Reviewed the primary DDCF publication and its open manuscript to distinguish demonstrated work from future
  research directions.
- Created `context-in-text/ddcf_content_specification.md` with approved implementation copy for:
  - The central DDCF project node and detail dialog.
  - Data-Driven Constitutive Modeling.
  - Learning Neural Operators.
  - GPU Acceleration.
  - Automatic Differentiation.
- Added project facts, external resources, key concepts, source provenance, editorial rules, and candidate visual
  asset mappings.
- Updated `frontend/src/app/ddcf/agent_instructions.md` to make the specification the required content source.
- Resolved the missing-description blocker for the four subprojects.
- Added a new blocked content decision: the CV and SNSF Data Portal expose different approved grant amounts, so the
  hub will omit the amount until the preferred public value is confirmed.

### 2026-07-30 — DDCF Interactive Hub Implementation Started

- Moved the remaining DDCF P0 implementation tasks to in-progress status.
- Confirmed the approved DDCF content specification as the single copy source for the interface.
- Confirmed the page architecture: a server-rendered route with an isolated client-side React Flow hub.
- Confirmed that the unresolved grant amount will not be exposed in the hub.

### 2026-07-30 — DDCF Interactive Hub Completed

- Replaced the `/ddcf` placeholder with an interactive React Flow research map.
- Added a central DDCF node and four draggable, connected research-direction nodes:
  - Data-Driven Constitutive Modeling.
  - Learning Neural Operators.
  - GPU Acceleration.
  - Automatic Differentiation.
- Added pan, zoom, fit-view controls, a mobile research-direction index, and descriptive canvas instructions.
- Added accessible detail dialogs for all five nodes with:
  - Escape-key and backdrop dismissal.
  - Keyboard focus trapping and focus restoration.
  - Semantic dialog labelling.
  - Project facts, key concepts, and verified external resources.
- Integrated the approved DDCF figures through `next/image`.
- Downloaded and integrated the unmodified official English SNSF logo for dark web backgrounds from the SNSF
  identity page, with the required funding acknowledgement and official grant link.
- Added route-specific metadata and preserved the route as a statically generated page.
- Added Framer Motion entrances and dialog transitions with `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
- Kept the disputed grant amount out of the interface pending confirmation.
- Validation:
  - ESLint: passed with zero errors and zero warnings.
  - Next.js production build: passed.
  - TypeScript: passed during the production build.
  - Static generation: passed for all seven generated pages, including `/ddcf`.
  - Local server route check: `/ddcf` returned HTTP 200.
  - Whitespace validation: `git diff --check` passed.
- Newly observed performance follow-ups:
  - `model_hw.png` needs a responsive `sizes` value.
  - The above-the-fold `contact_across_scales.png` image should be reviewed for eager loading.

### 2026-07-30 — DDCF Publication Preparation

- Created a project-specific DDCF social preview card using the established cyan, violet, and graphite visual system.
- Verified the generated card contains the required project title and funding context without a grant amount.
- Added the social card to the application and configured site-specific Open Graph and X metadata.
- Created the Sites project association and recorded only its non-secret project identifier in
  `frontend/.openai/hosting.json`.
- Prepared the private production-publication task.
- Publication is paused before source transfer because exporting the complete repository to the hosting provider
  requires explicit user authorization. No repository content has been sent to that host.

### 2026-07-30 — Grant Amount Decision and Responsive P1 Started

- Resolved the DDCF grant-amount decision: the approved public value is CHF 830,128, the lower of the two documented
  values.
- Started the responsive navigation and layout P1 across all four primary routes.
- Included active-route indication, keyboard focus, and mobile navigation behavior in the implementation scope.

### 2026-07-30 — Responsive Navigation and Layout P1 Completed

- Replaced the clipped single-row mobile navigation with an accessible menu below 720 px.
- Added:
  - A 44 × 44 px menu control with explicit expanded state.
  - Escape-key and backdrop dismissal.
  - Background-scroll locking while the menu is open.
  - Active-route styling and `aria-current="page"`.
  - Visible keyboard focus styles.
  - A sticky, translucent navigation bar with reduced-motion handling.
- Added a skip link and a semantic `main#main-content` landmark to every primary route.
- Reduced the global mobile page gutter from 2 rem to 1 rem.
- Applied the approved CHF 830,128 grant amount to the DDCF project facts and funding acknowledgement.
- Corrected responsive image-delivery warnings:
  - Added `sizes` to `model_hw.png`.
  - Added responsive `sizes` and eager loading to `contact_across_scales.png`.
  - Preserved the SNSF logo at its intrinsic aspect ratio.
- Responsive validation covered `/`, `/research`, `/teaching`, and `/ddcf` at:
  - Mobile: 390 × 844.
  - Tablet: 768 × 900.
  - Laptop: 1024 × 768.
  - Desktop: 1440 × 900.
- Validation results:
  - No horizontal overflow in any of the 16 route-and-size combinations.
  - All expected images loaded after viewport traversal.
  - Every route exposed `main#main-content`.
  - The mobile menu stayed inside the viewport and opened and closed with Escape on every route.
  - Sticky navigation, active DDCF route state, and a 1280 × 720 short viewport were verified.
  - ESLint: passed with zero errors and zero warnings.
  - Next.js production build and TypeScript: passed.
  - All application routes remained statically generated.
- Retained the known `metadataBase` build notice as a documented SEO follow-up because the canonical production URL
  is not yet confirmed.

### 2026-07-30 — Portfolio Content and Relevant Links P1 Started

- Started the Bio, Research, Teaching, and contact-resource content pass.
- Verified email, academic website, ORCID, employment, education, and industry history against the May 2026 CV.
- Verified the public EPFL profile, CIVIL-425 coursebook, LSMS student-project index, and selected Infoscience
  project records.
- Selected the existing May 2026 CV PDF as the downloadable website version after checking its first-page rendering
  and document metadata.
- Resolved the Teaching visual decision in favor of text-only presentation, as explicitly requested in `goal.md`.

### 2026-07-30 — Portfolio Content and Relevant Links P1 Completed

- Added the reusable `BioOverview` component with:
  - A profile summary based on the May 2026 CV.
  - Current SNSF Ambizione leadership at EPFL.
  - EPFL and Caltech academic trajectory.
  - NextForce Engineering structural-design and FEM experience.
  - The requested Seville wording: “the most beautiful city in the world, naturally”.
- Added verified Bio and footer links for:
  - `joaquin.garciasuarez@epfl.ch`.
  - `https://jgarciasuarez.github.io/`.
  - `https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8830-4348`.
  - `https://github.com/jgarciasuarez`.
  - `https://x.com/jgs_research`.
- Published the existing nine-page May 2026 CV as
  `frontend/public/Joaquin_Garcia-Suarez_CV_May_2026.pdf` and added download actions in Bio and Footer.
- Added DOI links to all seven selected Research publications.
- Made Teaching text-only by removing the solar-collector figure, following `goal.md`.
- Added Teaching links to:
  - The official EPFL CIVIL-425 coursebook.
  - Four selected supervised-project records in EPFL Infoscience.
  - The LSMS student-project index.
- Updated the component inventory for the responsive Navigation, new BioOverview, and expanded Footer.
- Validation:
  - PDF metadata: the copied CV remains optimized and contains all nine pages.
  - Teaching contains no image component.
  - ESLint: passed with zero errors and zero warnings.
  - Next.js production build and TypeScript: passed.
  - All application routes remained statically generated.
  - `git diff --check`: passed.
- Retained the known `metadataBase` notice as the only build notice; it remains tied to the unresolved canonical
  production URL.

### 2026-07-31 — Social Metadata, SEO, and Automatic Maintenance

- Reviewed the existing Open Graph artwork at its native 1536 × 1024 resolution. The title, DDCF network motif,
  funding context, contrast, and safe spacing remain legible and accurate; no artwork change was required.
- Centralized social metadata and added a complete Open Graph and X card to Home, Research, Teaching, and DDCF.
  Every route now supplies its own title, description, canonical URL, shared image dimensions, and descriptive
  image alternative text.
- Expanded static-export validation to parse every route's Open Graph, X card, robots directive, canonical URL, and
  Schema.org JSON-LD graph. It also verifies the actual PNG signature and 1536 × 1024 dimensions.
- Reconciled the public Person data with the project context and the current EPFL profile: Joaquin Garcia-Suarez,
  EPFL affiliation, Ambizione research role, public email, canonical site, ORCID, GitHub, X, and EPFL profiles.
- Normalized sitemap URLs to the trailing-slash URLs generated by the static export.
- Added `.github/dependabot.yml` for weekly npm and GitHub Actions updates targeting `agentic_web_design`.
- Added the weekly `Maintenance` workflow to build and validate indexable production metadata, test published
  external links, and compare live Dependabot runtime alerts with the reviewed security baseline.
- Enabled Dependabot alerts and security updates in the Carlos staging repository. Its reviewed inventory is three
  high runtime alerts (`postcss` ×2, `sharp` ×1) and one medium runtime alert (`postcss` ×1).
- Added a lockfile-backed security baseline that fails when Next.js, `postcss`, `sharp`, severity counts, or the
  reviewed advisory inventory changes without a new review.
- External-link validation found 21 reachable URLs, two DOI endpoints that return access-restricted HTTP 403 to
  automation, and zero broken links.
- Validation completed before publication:
  - YAML parsing: passed for Dependabot, Quality, and Maintenance configurations.
  - ESLint: passed with zero errors and zero warnings.
  - Security baseline: passed for three high and one medium reviewed runtime advisories.
  - Staging export: passed with `https://carloschd24.github.io` canonicals and `noindex, nofollow`.
  - Production export: passed with `https://jgarciasuarez.github.io` canonicals and `index, follow`.
  - Component tests: 4 passed.
  - Playwright route, responsive, dialog, image-viewer, and accessibility tests: 29 passed.
  - `git diff --check`: passed.
- Portability constraint: Carlos uses `agentic_web_design` as its default branch, so the new automations can run in
  staging immediately. The Joaquin source and Pages repositories still use other default branches; activation there
  remains an owner action for the migration meeting.
